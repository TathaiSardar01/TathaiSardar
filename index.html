    <h2>SSR Movement</h2>
    <p>In the year 2020, the case of SSR attracted me a lot. Later came to know that SSR was actually mudered by few biggies. I felt the need to fight for his justice. If I will not fight for him then tomorrow, I will be in place of him. May be I don't use to get family support in it but I never use to think that I am alone. I have millions of people along with me who are fighting for his justice. The brutal way he is murdered, is something who had made me awake whole night. I took pledge that I will not leave his culprits roam freely. I as a responsible citizen of India and as a fangirl is fighting for his justice and will fight till we will get justice. </p>
    <br>
    <p>I have make total 5- 6 websites on SSR. Below is one of them</p>
